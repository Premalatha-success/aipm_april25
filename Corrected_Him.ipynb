Then the selling realtor tried pushing us to use a local lender\\u2026.._x000D_\\nAfter our initial conversations with Alex we knew he was the broker we wanted to work with and my wife agreed so we refused to switch to a local lender and are very happy we did! Alex went above and beyond to get things done for us and was available both way before normal business hours on a morning and into the night as well, including on weekends. _x000D_\\nAs our purchase progressed, Susan\\u2019s caution changed to admiration as she complimented Alex and Pacific Beneficial to us on several occasions for their professionalism, responsiveness and commented on how easy they were making things for her on the loan side. In the end, we were in a position to close a full week early due to the hard work Alex and his team put in._x000D_\\nWhen it came to closing and sitting down to sign all of the necessary paperwork our escrow officer commented that \\u201cThis is a great rate, you must have a friend at the Mortgage Company\\u201d?...

I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website. Unlike other banks with which I do business, the NASB website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries. For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled. However, when the escrow amount changed, NASB debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited. NASB sent me a \"credit counseling letter\" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services. When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current. Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from NASB's default department. The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me. The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that NASB's system was not set up to adjust anything. After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service. I specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran \n",

What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I'd rate this Bank lower than one star\n",

The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check. Then five days later (while driving from ID to NC) I had to coordinate having closing docs (which I already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so I could send to them.

In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying \"OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him \"thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate.\" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying \"when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know\". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too. At the end of round one, his rates and fees were VERY competitive though - pretty near the best of the bunch\n",

We’ve had personal and family issues that devastated our credit to the point where we felt that it would be a waste of time since we’d never be approved.  However, a real need arose when Dad’s declining health demanded we make room in our home so we can keep him close to us and give him the care he needs.  We weren’t sure what to expect from Patrick G at Reliance, but we were soon reassured and thoroughly delighted when Pat informed us that we were eligible and that he’d walk us through the entire process personally!  There simply are no superlatives sufficient to thank you for your fantastic guidance in getting our home refinanced!  You took what we assumed would be a challenging home refinance and successfully navigated us through the process to a successful conclusion.  In every single step, you proved to be friendly, patient, polite, knowledgeable, professional and consistently available to us.   We can't remember the last company we dealt with that returned calls and emails in such a timely manner!  You even personally called on weekends when there were items that needed our attention!  What more can a person ask for in a mortgage broker?  I will happily and enthusiastically recommend you to others.  Thanks Patrick for all your support and assistance... Read More_x000D_\n",

            "I was looking for a way to consolidate my current debt when I submitted a loan request to Lending Tree. I received an email from Steven Shatz and decided to give him a call to see what he could offer based on his reviews on Lending Tree. Once we started talking I knew that he was willing to work with me to get my best option on the table. We settled and closed fairly quickly and he worked through a few issues with me right by my side. He was always a phone call, text or email away and never delayed in returning my messages. I would highly recommend not only Reliance First Capital but Steven Shatz for all your mortgage needs.... Read More_x000D_\n",

            "The experience with Reliance was extremely frustrating and aggravating. First the loan \"mgr\" asked for the usual pile of paper, including the 4506T to prove I paid my taxes. Fine, but then they wanted copies of my tax returns so they could compare. Since when are they tax auditors? Unable to find the copy for 2011, I had the IRS send us the transcript of it, and sent it via PO, and electronically. But then it was held up for 3 weeks because the transcript was mailed by us, and not the IRS. Now we are getting ridiculous. So we had the IRS fax it to them directly, AND STILL they had a problem with it's \"authenticity\". They received everything we had, with no discrepancies, yet the loan mgr suggested we go ahead and \"dummy up\" a copy, as long as it would match exactly. We said no, the two separate transcripts were accurate, and they could use those, or we would walk. Amazing that a week later they finally approved it. This guy had emailed and called every day, sometimes as many as 4 times, even during our Christmas trip to Dallas, only to sit and wait, and wonder what the black hole was doing. And to make it more annoying, he had a demeaning way of speaking, saying \"Does that make sense?\", after every statement, as if I couldn't understand basic English. One of those things people say when they want people to feel inferior. They requested the 4506T 4 more times, so we sent them at least 8 to make sure. So that didn't \"make sense\", nor did their inability to accept the IRS transcripts sent from the IRS, nor the harassment for other tax copies while we were visiting my sons in Dallas over Christmas. I certainly would not want my friends to feel my frustration... Read More_x000D_\n",

            "I am a first time homebuyer and was originally going to go with a local mortgage broker for my loan, but wanted to shop around for a potential better rate, so I used LendingTree which is how Kirk contacted me. My original lender had offered to pay for my home appraisal in writing, and, wanting to compete, Kirk said he would pay for the appraisal (which he stated in writing) and asked for the letter the other lender had provided so he could get permission to have Pacific Beneficial pay for my appraisal. Kirk confirmed I would not be paying for the appraisal and was very happy with what Kirk was doing to accommodate me as a customer. However, when I closed on the home, the cost of the appraisal was on my Final Buyer’s Statement ($525). As Kirk had said that I would not be paying for the appraisal, I thought I would be reimbursed.

            "I am a first time homebuyer and was originally going to go with a local mortgage broker for my loan, but wanted to shop around for a potential better rate, so I used LendingTree which is how Kirk contacted me. My original lender had offered to pay for my home appraisal in writing, and, wanting to compete, Kirk said he would pay for the appraisal (which he stated in writing) and asked for the letter the other lender had provided so he could get permission to have Pacific Beneficial pay for my appraisal. Kirk confirmed I would not be paying for the appraisal and was very happy with what Kirk was doing to accommodate me as a customer. However, when I closed on the home, the cost of the appraisal was on my Final Buyer’s Statement ($525). As Kirk had said that I would not be paying for the appraisal, I thought I would be reimbursed. I reached out to Kirk via email after close and got no further response than “We paid for appraisal upfront but we get reimbursed.” I then reached out to Kirk two times via email with no response. I then called the office and spoke to Kirk’s boss’ admin who instructed me to reach out to Kirk’s boss, Adam Carrion, which I did. It was only then that I received an email response from Kirk stating that the lender credit I received, which was less than the appraisal, was all I would receive to cover the cost, despite the fact that when I was entering into the loan Kirk told me that Pacific Beneficial would be paying for the appraisal and I would be receiving a lender credit. Kirk asked me to call him, which I did and left a voicemail, and he never called me back. I called Kirk again leaving a voicemail with no response. I then began reaching out to his boss Adam Carrion via email to continue to explain the situation. Only then did I receive an email from Kirk asking me to call him, which I did, left a voicemail, and received no response. I then called Adam and spoke to him on the phone and only then did I receive a call from Kirk, offering me a nominal amount of money.

I reached out to Kirk and Adam via email to check in on status with no response. The next day I reached out again, voicing my displeasure and that I was going to take action via reviews.

            "This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I'd rate this Bank lower than one star... Read More_x000D_\n",

            "I never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation...

            "It all started when Bob G ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent. When I agreed to use NASB, Bob told me that they could close in less than 4 weeks...it took 9. The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check. Then five days later (while driving from ID to NC) I had to coordinate having closing docs (which I already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so I could send to them.

We have excellent credit, plenty of income, etc. NASB rep made tons of promises to get us to sign up, but then just a few weeks before the closing, she just disappeared, and failed to give us a lock or firm closing date! Thankfully, we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only 3 weeks. NASB rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on; this became very apparent towards the end. Not sure to this day why she didn't want our business other than they apparently cannot follow through for some reason or another. I'm sure there are good lenders here, but this is not one of them...

In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying \"OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him \"thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate.\" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying \"when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know\". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too.

            "I was working with a loan consultant from NASB and she told me that she would give me a rate of 4.875% for a 30 year fixed loan with a total closing cost of $2300. I asked her to send me the good faith estimate. The good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning.

I always hear about the stress and challenges when buying a house, but the day Peter called and told me we were all good to go and would be closing in a couple weeks I laughed and honestly thought he was joking.  That’s how simple and quick they were with my loan; I was actually able to enjoy the entire process from application to closing.   Their response time to emails was unbelievable; you would have a response within minutes at almost all hours of the day.  All in all, they exceeded the bar with customer service (would of given them 100 stars if it was option), were extremely fast in the loan process, got me an outstanding rate, and continued to call all the way through closing to make sure everything was going well!  If you’re in the market to buy a home or refinance Peter and his team are the ones for you.  Thank you so much for all you did, I can never thank you enough!  All the best to you...

Without a doubt, Anthony has been the best mortgage banker that we have worked with.  Anthony always responded swiftly two emails and phone calls, often times on his days off or after hours.  Anthony was always professional and knowledgeable. Honestly, he made us feel like we were his only client . Often times, refinancing your home is a stressful and laborious process. Anthony made our refinance painless. We would recommend him 100% ... Read More_x000D_\n",

He was detailed in his explanation of the mortgage process, introduced me to everyone on his team (who were all wonderful as well), and my loan was clear to close way ahead of schedule. My realtor and my attorney were super impressed with the service he provided me. I recommend him to everyone I know who is looking for a mortgage... Read More_x000D_\n",

We were very happy with how quickly and easily the loan took from start to finish.  The loan officer Matthew McDevitt was available when needed, but not overbearing.  We had a previous poor experience with a lender that made numerous promises, even in writing, and then as closing approached changed the deal in dramatic fashion, which was caused us to eventually decide not to move forward.  This deal happened faster than anticipated with literally no hang-ups.  We would totally recommend Guaranteed Rate. To those that question using an online lender, several trusted sources pointed us in this direction, but in fairness we considered that we don't really personally know our local banker either and lack of face-to-face interaction does not stop all types of business we take part in daily.

Mr. Germain made the transition to a new home so much easier because of his knowledge and compassion.

He was super helpful, friendly and ensured that he answered all my questions to ensure that we werent wasting each other's time.

The underwriter did not tell me about additional items needed until the very last week before closing, and I feel that she should have been able to give me that list when I called to check status 2 to 2 1/2 weeks prior. At that point I was told that everything was good to go and just waiting on the appraisal. I live in Hawaii and buying here means that there is a 4 day lag time from when you sign to when the closing is actual. The items she was demanding would take 10-14 business days to get and I had already purchased my airline ticket, shipped my vehicle and household goods. There was no compassion and it came across as she was the word of GOD and I would have to bow her will. The company did not even offer any assistance for having to pay for the changes I had to do with my time and schedule as well as the airfare. They only care when it comes to getting your MONEY!

            "This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now \"too old.\" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I'd rate this Bank lower than one star... Read More_x000D_\n",

            "I never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as I. That mistake was using North American Savings Bank over other lenders. I started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. Communication with the company was below average after I confirmed that I would be pursuing a loan with them. I had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. The company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn't. This led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. After having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. When I was able to reach the loan officer I was told that I would personally have to find additional comps in my area. I was more than a little annoyed as this is what I was going to be paying them for, however I complied. After contacting area realtors and securing what I believe were suitable comps I forwarded them to the officer. A week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. At that time I was told that my comps weren't sufficient and as a result they couldn't ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment's findings. As a result they would not be issuing me a loan. By the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. I should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. He did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. I'm now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that I can't use. In other words I will have to pay for a new assessment. I'm also out the money for credit reports and of course I'll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan I secure. I was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money I had spent. I expect to be paying for my mistake for years. I should point out that I refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. I strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass North American Savings Bank no matter what they promise. Save yourself time, money and a lot of aggravation...

            "It all started when Bob G ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent. When I agreed to use NASB, Bob told me that they could close in less than 4 weeks...it took 9. The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check. Then five days later (while driving from ID to NC) I had to coordinate having closing docs (which I already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so I could send to them. Of the four houses I purchased in the past 9 years this was the most stressful... Read More_x000D_\n",

            "What a horrible experience. We have excellent credit, plenty of income, etc. NASB rep made tons of promises to get us to sign up, but then just a few weeks before the closing, she just disappeared, and failed to give us a lock or firm closing date! Thankfully, we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with lower rates in only 3 weeks. NASB rep constantly complained about being too busy and having too many matters to work on; this became very apparent towards the end. Not sure to this day why she didn't want our business other than they apparently cannot follow through for some reason or another. I'm sure there are good lenders here, but this is not one of them...

            "Rep was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful when we first spoke. In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying \"OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from NASB over a week to respond. So I replied to him \"thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate.\" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying \"when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know\". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too. At the end of round one, his rates and fees were VERY competitive though - pretty near the best of the bunch... Read More_x000D_\n",

            "I was working with a loan consultant from NASB and she told me that she would give me a rate of 4.875% for a 30 year fixed loan with a total closing cost of $2300. I asked her to send me the good faith estimate. The good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. When I called her for explanation of the extra $600 she said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. What an explanation!!!! She knew my state from the beginning and I repeatedly asked her for a 'TOTAL' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. As a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a 'STATE TAX' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. I am not supposed to know what are the different compoents/fees or taxes that apply during closing. She does this everyday and she could have been honest with me from the beginning. I expected honest communication from a loan consultant from NASB bank and I did not receive that. I am very disappointed... Read More_x000D_\n",

            "the experience with reliance was extremely frustrating and aggravating first the loan mgr asked for the usual pile of paper including the 4506t to prove i paid my taxes fine but then they wanted copies of my tax returns so they could compare since when are they tax auditors unable to find the copy for 2011 i had the irs send us the transcript of it and sent it via po and electronically but then it was held up for 3 weeks because the transcript was mailed by us and not the irs now we are getting ridiculous so we had the irs fax it to them directly and still they had a problem with its authenticity they received everything we had with no discrepancies yet the loan mgr suggested we go ahead and dummy up a copy as long as it would match exactly we said no the two separate transcripts were accurate and they could use those or we would walk amazing that a week later they finally approved it this guy had emailed and called every day sometimes as many as 4 times even during our christmas trip to dallas only to sit and wait and wonder what the black hole was doing and to make it more annoying he had a demeaning way of speaking saying does that make sense after every statement as if i couldnt understand basic english one of those things people say when they want people to feel inferior they requested the 4506t 4 more times so we sent them at least 8 to make sure so that didnt make sense nor did their inability to accept the irs transcripts sent from the irs nor the harassment for other tax copies while we were visiting my sons in dallas over christmas i certainly would not want my friends to feel my frustration read morex000d\n",
